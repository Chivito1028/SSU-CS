# Assignment 1
My favorite Website was [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) It impressed me what people could 
make using Web Gl as well as how little code some of thegreat visuals took. As a person that has not 
used Web Gl and have no idea how to even begin how to build something like that , it makes me very excited
for this course and expanding my skills.
